TODO:
- Output encoders (Save + stream) => Done as in save to file and provide via tcpserversink
- Verify that other incoming formats (H264 with AAC audio) are working => H264 with vorbis is working (see below)
- Draw stuff onto the scene (logos, sprites, text on sprite, ...) => DONE! Enhancement: Maybe fade text in and out?
- Handle EOS properly (problem seems to exist in CamBox and VideoPlayer! => RECHECK
- Remove fading or make it optional => DONE! TODO: make that work via MIDI?
- Make the user interface localisable (by using tr() a little more often :)
- Support pipelines/sources/videos with only video or only audio. Maybe by using bins and listening to PadAdded events?
- Make all settings (resolution, framerate, audio sample rate, send destinations, ...) configurable
- Allow video effects to be applied (like gstreamer's agingtv or convert to black and white)
- Allow audio effects to be applied (lv2 host interface should give best flexibility)
- Optimize buffering time by using parameters for the tcpserversink like "sync-method", "burst-format" and finally "burst-value" => played with it, no good
- Add AudioMeters for MAIN and MONITOR out
- Add a "clear monitor" button in the "master" section
- Add a "new connection" dialog so the command line doesn't have to be used << !! NEXT !!
- Make sure all MIDI control stuff works
- Hook up the nanoKontrol's Transport buttons to the videoPlayer

- Move all file selection dialogs to new threads!!!
- Basically the UI stuff and media stuff has to be in different threads since on regain-focus of the mainwindow, there are glitches (hearable audio dropouts and short video stall on the UI!
